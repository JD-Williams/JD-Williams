### Hi! It's nice to meet you. :wave:

My name is Jonathan D. Williams&mdash;although most people call me "J.D."&mdash;and I am a Jamaican ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡² American ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. In my heart, I am a musician. In real life, I am a mathematician. In my mind, I am a superhero; however, I typically enjoy helping others by paying my blessings forward.

Currently, I teach mathematics in New York City and I have a knack for unraveling puzzles that vex others. Often times, I try to learn new technologies to broaden my skillset. I strive to use my STEM background to design and implement creative, sustainable solutions for complex problems. 

Just in case we don't have an opportunity to chat anytime soon, the following are a few tidbits of information about me. If anything piques your interest, feel free to [reach out](mailto:jdwill917@live.com) so we can speak directly.

* :house: My family is everything to me
* :airplane: Travelling is, in my opinion, the best way to learn about different cultures
* :camera: I enjoy recreational photography and I also have graphic design skills to complement this pastime
* :game_die: The only "game" I have... is Sudoku (and sometimes Minesweeper)
* :movie_camera: Marvel >>> D.C.
* :computer: I am continuously learning new DevOps practices and technologies to efficiently deploy apps to the cloud
